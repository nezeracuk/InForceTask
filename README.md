# Actual task
We need to build a product list web app. The goal is to simulate a shop app.
There are two primary views: the product list view and the product view.
##
### On the list view
I can add products by clicking on the add button(after that modal window
should occur with different inputs which allows me to set product details, also inside modal
window should be two buttons, for confirmation and for canceling) and remove products
(When pressing the delete button I should see a modal with confirmation of removing this
product - I can either confirm or cancel the current action). You shouldn`t be able to add an
empty product without setting data for him.
The list view should always sort alphabetically first, and then by count. Also I can select how
products should be sorted from the dropdown menu.
##
### Product View:
On the product view, I can see all of the details of the product. After pressing the edit
button I can see the modal with different inputs which allows me to change product details.
Also you can add and delete comments for the current product.
